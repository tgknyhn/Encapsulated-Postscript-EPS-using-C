# Encapsulated-Postscript-EPS-using-C
* EPS is a graph format that you can create vector images like polyline, polygone, ellipse, etc.
* By using the functions in the eps_graph, you can create your own EPS(encapsulated postscript) file. The operations available : 

-> Appending a figure \
-> Setting the thickness\
-> Setting the color\
-> Inserting a node\
-> Drawing the function f(x)\
-> Drawing a polyline\
-> Drawing a polygon\
-> Drawing an ellipse\
-> Scaling the figure\
-> Resizing the figure\
-> Merging two figures\
-> Exporting the EPS file\

* To run the driver code that I have created, simply run the makefile by writing "run" to the terminal.
* Driver code shows the usage of all available operations
